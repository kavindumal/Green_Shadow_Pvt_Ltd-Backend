# Crop Monitoring System

## Overview

Green Shadow (Pvt) Ltd. is a mid-scale farm specializing in root crops and cereals. The company operates at both national and international levels and is renowned in its field for high-quality production. This project aims to introduce a comprehensive system to manage their crops and other assets, focusing on the following areas:

- **Field**: Land allocated for cultivation with several fields designated for specific crop types.
- **Crop**: Type of crop grown in a particular field.
- **Staff**: Manages human resources as well as field and crop operations.
- **Monitoring Log**: Records observations and activities related to fields and crops.
- **Vehicle**: Manages vehicles assigned to staff for monitoring and supporting agricultural operations.
- **Equipment**: Oversees the agricultural equipment used in various operations.

## Business Process

### User Access
Users can log into the system as MANAGER, ADMINISTRATIVE, or SCIENTIST. 

### CRUD Operations
Principal users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on relevant entities.

### Data Analysis
- **Relational Analysis**: Evaluates relationships, such as driver and labor allocations to vehicles.
- **Spatial and Temporal Analysis**: Supports location-based and time-based analysis of resources.

### Permissions and Access Limitations
- **MANAGER**: Full access to perform all CRUD operations.
- **ADMINISTRATIVE**: Cannot edit crop data, field data, or monitor logs related to crop details.
- **SCIENTIST**: Cannot modify staff, vehicle, or equipment data.

## Main Services

## Guidelines

### General
1. **Validation**: Validation is required on both the client side and the server side.
2. **Sorting**: Entities should be sortable by name, designation, gender, vehicle type, land size, and status.
3. **UI/UX**: Emphasis on user experience, color psychology, and neatness.
4. **Password Security**: User credentials must be validated with password encryption.
5. **Authentication & Authorization**: Use Spring Security and OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.
